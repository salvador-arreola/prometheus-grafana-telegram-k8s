# Prometheus-Grafana-Telegram-Kubernetes

With this files you can deploy a Kubernetes environment that includes monitoring with [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus), alerts to Telegram using [Alert Manager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) and visualize metrics with [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).

## Description of files

For implementation, you need to change certain values in certain files, let's describe them.

### Prometheus

The first file ```00-prometheus-namespace.yaml```, like his name indicate, only creates a namespace named monitoring (You can change its name, but you need to replace new namespace name in almost all files).

For ```01-prometheus-cluster-role.yaml``` file, gives to Prometheus necessary permissions access to Kubernetes cluster metrics.

In file ```02-prometheus-configmap.yaml``` has important configurations of this implementation, such as metrics name and alerts. First configuration is   __prometheus.rules__, in this part you can add custom rules for Alert Manager, there are example rules such as _High Node Memory_, _High Memory Usage in Pod_, _High Node CPU_, _Node Failover_, _etc_., all based in kubernetes metrics. For more information about how this rules works, consult [Prometheus Alerting](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) documentation. Second configuration is __prometheus.yml__, that contains values such as scrap interval, evaluation time of rules, path location of __prometheus.rules__ and where is allocated Alert Manager (in this case, Kubernetes service). More information in [Prometheus Configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/)

Using ```03-prometheus-deployment.yaml``` can deploy Prometheus application, this file uses version ```v2.29.2```. You need to change value ```<Your Time Zone>``` of environment variable __TZ__ with you respective [Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) or just delete it.

```yml
env:
  - name: TZ
    value: <Your Time Zone>
```
Last file for Prometheus is ```04-prometheus-svc.yaml```, that is only a __Kubernetes NodePort__ service in port 30000, you can change this exposed port or change service type.

### Alert Manager

First file ```05-prometheus-alertmanager-configmap.yaml``` is a ConfigMap for __alertmanager.yml__ parameters, such as timers for alerts, type of alerts and receivers. In this part, the Telegram receiver is configured to receive alerts, so that you need to create Telegram bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), it will return your bot token. After that, create a chat group in Telegram and add your bot there, and make the following GET request ```https://api.telegram.org/bot<Your Bot Token>/getUpdates``` and you will obtain your Chat ID.

Replace ```<Your Telegram Chat ID>``` with the value you got from your bot, _**with everything inside the quotes**_. (Some Chat ID's start with a ```-```, in this case, you must also include the ```-``` in the url).

The URL ```http://prometheus-bot:9087``` is a __Kubernetes ClusterIP__ service and behind it is a deployment with a Prometheus Bot that recive alerts and send to chat group in Telegram.

```yml
receivers:
- name: webhook-telegram
  webhook_configs:
    - send_resolved: false
      url: 'http://prometheus-bot:9087/alert/<Your Telegram Chat ID>'
```

For more information [Alert Manager Configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/) is your ally.

Next file, ```06-prometheus-alertmanager-deployment.yaml``` is deployment for Alert Manager, using ```v0.23.0 version``` . You need to change value ```<Your Time Zone>``` of environment variable __TZ__ too or just delete it.

Last file, ```07-prometheus-alertmanager-svc.yaml``` is a __Kubernetes ClusterIP__ service, because in this case, no need to expose deployment to the world, only Prometheus can access to this service.
